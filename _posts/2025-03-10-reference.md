## TL;DR

- [**vLLM Production Stack**](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack), originally from academic research, is now an official [**open-source reference implementation**](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/deployment/k8s.html) of a cluster-wide full-stack vLLM serving system, including K8s-native router, autoscaling, CR-based LoRA management, distributed KV sharing, monitoring, etc.
- Why does it matter to the industry? 
  - A vibrant [**OPEN community**](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/blob/main/community/community-event.md) with official vLLM [**UPSTREAM support**](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/12953).
  - Designed for **K8s-NATIVE** deployment with **Performance optimizations**[LINK HERE] tailored for LLM applications.


## Why vLLM Production Stack?

**AGI** isn't just about better models--it also needs better **systems that serve the models** so that every one would have access to the models! In order to fully harness the power of Generative AI, every organization that take this AI revolution seriously needs to have access to the best LLM serving infrastructure with high performance, availability, and with cost as low as possible.

vLLM Production Stack is borne out of a long-time **academic collaboration** between the vLLM team (**UC Berkeley**) and the LMCache team (**UChicago**), an research-inspired KV-cache optimization system ([CacheGen](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651890.3672274), [CacheBlend](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444)). 
As more vLLM and LMCache users ask us for help with deploying our projects in their production settings, we see a pressing need for an **official reference implementation** of a cluster-wide vLLM serving system. Thus, we released [**vLLM Production Stack**](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack) in early January 2025. 


## Open Community + Upstream vLLM Support

## Open Community + Official vLLM Support

The project welcomes **EVERYONE** to contribute. It has a growing and vibrant contributor community with over 30 active contributors from various companies worldwide, including IBM, Lambda, HuggingFace, TensorChord and more.
Check out our community meeting notes [**here**](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/blob/main/community/community-event.md).

Moreover, we ensure that the latest vLLM Production Stack is always compatible with the latest vLLM releases, thanks to the [**LMCache KV Connector**] (vLLM PR [1](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/12953),[2](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/10502)) in the upstream main-branch vLLM.

In short, as our community grows, people never need to worry whether their contributions to the production stack might conflict with the vLLM releases.


## K8s-Native Deployment + Optimized Performance

When deploying Kubernetes-native solutions, operators often have to choose either "K8s-native" or "optimized performance." With vLLM Production Stack, you can have BOTH K8s-native support AND OPTIMIZED performance. 

With [**one-click installer**](LINK HERE!!), everyone can create a multi-vLLM-instance cluster in a K8s environment in 2 minutes. 

It supports features for Kubernetes operators (e.g. [CR-based router](LINK HERE), [sidecar-based LoRA adapter management](LINK HERE), [K8s-native autoscaling](LINK HERE), [distributed KV cache sharing](LINK HERE) via direct point-to-point sharing or hierarchical structure), while incorporating latest research from academia ([CacheGen](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651890.3672274), [CacheBlend](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444)).

In short, vLLM production stack showcases the promise when academic research and industry expertise join forces! 

## Cost Efficiency and Compute Optimization

Deploying LLMs in production isn't just about technical capabilities—it's about making economic sense. vLLM Production Stack delivers significant cost advantages through several key optimizations:

- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Our distributed KV cache sharing (based on [**LMCache**](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache)) and LLM-aware routing reduces memory redundancy and compute wastage across replicas, allowing you to serve more concurrent users with the same hardware.

- **Intelligent Autoscaling**: The system scales resources up and down based on actual demand patterns, eliminating wasteful over-provisioning while maintaining performance.

- **Real-world Cost Savings**: Early adopters report 30-40% cost reduction in real-world deployment compared to traditional serving solutions while maintaining or improving response times.

These efficiency gains translate directly to your bottom line. Whether you're a startup watching every dollar or an enterprise managing large-scale deployments, vLLM Production Stack helps maximize the return on your AI investment.

## Concluding Words

**We also welcome more people to join us to build a future** where every application can harness the power of LLM inference—reliably, at scale, and without breaking a sweat.
