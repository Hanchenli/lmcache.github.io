## TL;DR

- [**vLLM Production Stack**](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack), originally an academic open-source project, is now an official [**reference implementation**](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/deployment/k8s.html) of a cluster-wide full-stack vLLM serving system, including K8S-native router, autoscaling, LoRA management, distributed KV sharing, monitoring, etc.
- Why does it matter to the industry? 
  - A growing, vibrant [**OPEN community**](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/blob/main/community/community-event.md) with official vLLM [**UPSTREAM support**](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/12953).
  - Designed for both **OPTIMIZED performance** [LINKS?] and **K8S-NATIVE** deployment.


## Why vLLM Production Stack?

**AGI** isn't just about better models--it also needs better **systems that serve the models**! Every organization that takes AGI seriously needs the best LLM serving infra, with high availability, speed, and low cost.

vLLM Production Stack is borne out of a long-time **academic collaboration** between the vLLM team (**UC Berkeley**) and the LMCache team (**UChicago**), an research-inspired KV-cache optimization system ([CacheGen](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651890.3672274), [CacheBlend](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444)). 
As more vLLM and LMCache users ask us for help with deploying our projects in their production settings, we see a pressing need for an **official reference implementation** of a cluster-wide vLLM serving system. Thus, we released [**vLLM Production Stack**](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack) early January 2025. 



## Open Community + Official vLLM Support

The project welcomes **EVERYONE** to contribute. It has a growing and vibrant contributor community with over 30 active contributors from various companies worldwide, including IBM, Lambda, ??, ??
Check out our community meeting notes [**here**](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/blob/main/community/community-event.md).

Moreover, we ensure that the latest vLLM Production Stack is always compatible with the latest vLLM releases, thanks to the [**LMCache KV Connector**](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/12953) in the upstream main-branch vLLM.

In short, as our community grows, people never need to worry whether their contributions to the production stack might conflict with the vLLM releases.



## K8S-Native Deployment + Optimized Performance

When deploying Kubernetes-native solutions, operators often have to choose either "K8S-native" or "optimized performance." With vLLM Production Stack, you can have BOTH K8S-native support AND OPTIMIZED performance. 

With [**one-click installer**](LINK HERE!!), everyone can create a multi-vLLM-instance cluster in a K8S environment in 2 minutes. 

It supports [CR-based router](LINK HERE), [sidecar-based LoRA adapter management](LINK HERE), [K8S-native autoscaling](LINK HERE), and [distributed KV cache sharing](LINK HERE) (i.e., direct point-to-point sharing or hierarchical structure). 

In short, vLLM production stack showcases the promise when academic research and industry expertise join forces! 

## Cost Efficiency and Compute Optimization

Deploying LLMs in production isn't just about technical capabilities—it's about making economic sense. vLLM Production Stack delivers significant cost advantages through several key optimizations:

- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Our distributed KV cache sharing (based on [**LMCache**](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache)) and LLM-aware routing reduces memory redundancy and compute wastage across replicas, allowing you to serve more concurrent users with the same hardware.

- **Intelligent Autoscaling**: The system scales resources up and down based on actual demand patterns, eliminating wasteful over-provisioning while maintaining performance.

- **Real-world Cost Savings**: Early adopters report 30-40% cost reduction in real-world deployment compared to traditional serving solutions while maintaining or improving response times.

These efficiency gains translate directly to your bottom line. Whether you're a startup watching every dollar or an enterprise managing large-scale deployments, vLLM Production Stack helps maximize the return on your AI investment.

## Concluding Words

**We also welcome more people to join us to build a future** where every application can harness the power of LLM inference—reliably, at scale, and without breaking a sweat.
